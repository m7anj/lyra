# Lyra

## The Voice-Powered Music Finder

**Ever had a song stuck in your head but couldnâ€™t remember its name?**  
**Lyra** lets you sing or say any lyrics, and it instantly finds the song for you. Unlike apps like Shazam, which only work with pre-recorded songs, **Lyra** works with your voice. Once you find the song, you can instantly create a playlist of similar tracks with just one click. Powered by speech recognition, natural language processing, and music search APIs, **Lyra** makes discovering, curating, and building your music tastes more intuitive than ever.
